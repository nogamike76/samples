# Highly Available Ingress with layer 7 NVAs

This sample template will deploy an Front-end Azure Load Balancer in front of two simulated NVA VMs.  The NVA VMs will forward requests on port 80 to a Web-tier Azure Load Balancer, which will distribute traffic across two back-end VMs running a simple web server.

For more information on this deployment and other highly available NVA options, see [Deploy highly available NVAs](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/nva-ha?branch=WIP-360720-hanva-refresh). TODO: Remove review link
